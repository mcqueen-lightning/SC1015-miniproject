## Problem Definition
create a mathematical model that will predict sales volumes after a certain number of years based on the productâ€™s genre, platform, publisher and the franchise or series it belongs to.
## Model Used
1) Linear Regression
2) Random Forest Regression
3) Gradient Boosting Regression
## Conclusion
- Models used does no accuratly predict the global sales column
- Predicting game rating first then using another model to find correlation between sales volumn and game rating might be a more accurate prediction instead.
